This is a collection of small scripts designed for the Bloons Tower Defense games.

ability.py - lets you use hotkeys for abilities. Intended to replicate BTD5 ability hotkeys in BMC, though technically could do more.

clicker.py - auto start round. Intended to substitute for auto-start in BTD5 Co-op mode.

More to be added as I make them.
